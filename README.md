# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to complete it to prove to myself I am capable of learning new things and applying them in real time.
I built this project to have a study guide that vaguely goes over the core of front-end web development.
The study guide is very useful for those who are brand new to this field and can give you some insight on what to expect.
I've learned many things through this precourse workout, some retained most not.
